In this Project we solve maze using **Breadth First Search(BFS) approach**, we also demonstrate manual solution to find the shortest path of MAZE  with unclear route(like WHEELED ROBOT MOVE IN HOTEL) using BFS , This methods is used to analyse the cost, time and business it can provide in real time.






<ins>**ANALYSIS**</ins>

The shortest path can be find using Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search . However In this project  Breadth-First Search is used to find shortest path successfully. For the Leetcode question both the approaches takes same time and space, but in general For mazes specifically (if we define a maze as there being only one way to reach a cell from the starting point without backtracking, meaning it's essentially a tree), **BFS** will generally use more memory, as we'll need to keep multiple paths in memory at the same time, where **DFS** only needs to keep track of a single path at any given time.





<ins>**INSTALLATION**</ins>

I use [python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) as a primary tools for Window 10 for 
development. Also see [python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-version-on-mac-update/) for MAC.
Basically, to reproduce enviroment, you need to run `pip install -r 
requirements.txt` with certain version of python.

Special Thanks to **Prof Henry Chang** for providing guidence throughout this project.
